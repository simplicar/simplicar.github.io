### Jekyll Serve

Then, start the Jekyll Server. I always like to give the `--watch` option so it updates the generated HTML when I make changes.

```
$> jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site.

### Deployment

```
$> git push origin master
```
